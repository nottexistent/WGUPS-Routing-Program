What the program is:
A program that delivers a list of packages provided in a .CSV file.

How to run:
To run, run main.py, a menu will show up with different options.

How it works:
This project was done for class C950 and took 3 days.
The program takes two .csv files, one with a list of the packages and another with a matrix of distances.
It takes the data in these classes and creates the appropriate objects. Package objects, address objects, and a distance 2D array.
The trucks are created and are then manually assigned packages to deliver. 
Using the nearest neighbor algorithm the trucks then load the packages for delivery.
They then deliver them in the order that they are loaded.
